# Streamer Browser
The Streamer Browser is intended as a lightweight web browser that only keeps track of audio streaming sites and locations.

### Current State
Currently nothing is implemented. In the docs there are markups of the intended design. That's the first step here will be to turn those png's into html and css that are renderable. Then we'll update the pages to actually do things.

### Milestones
##### 1.0
- Implement Design in Mockups - Without play/pause/skip.
- Streaming tabs in sidebar should be saved at shutdown and last playing station should reload at startup.

##### 1.1
- Implement play/pause/skip sites for supported, built-in sites
- Integrate OS media keys to work with the streaming sites

##### 1.2
- Allow users to integrate with non-built-in streaming sites.

##### 2.0
- Design a playlist interface that will allow users to schedule a list of streaming sites from their sidebar into a long list.

##### 3.0
- Update interface to allow for selecting from some pre-defined streaming sites and playlists.
